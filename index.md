In this study, we aim to investigate whether text mining of food product reviews
can aid in the identification and ranking of food safety issues. Specifically,
we focus on assessing whether text mining of the millions of consumer reviews
posted online can be useful for early identification of unsafe food products
that have the potential to cause foodborne disease outbreaks. The two aims of
this project are: (1) mine and integrate a large corpus of data posted online to
understand trends and features in unsafe food product reports, and (2) develop a
machine-learning/informatics approach for early identification of unsafe food
products. The data sources considered for this project include, recalls of food
products from the FDA, and USDA and online product reviews.
